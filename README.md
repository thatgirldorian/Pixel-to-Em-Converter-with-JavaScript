# Pixel-to-em-converter-with-JavaScript

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is a simple converter that converts your pixels to em. I coded it in JavaScript.

Where a user leaves one field empty, I added an alert to remind them to fill in both fields so the converter does not throw any errors.

<h3>Technology Used:</h3>

- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript
